The idea was to translate the original\r\nQwt C++ code to Python and then to optimize some parts of the code by\r\nwriting new modules based on NumPy and other libraries.\r\n\r\nThe ``PythonQwt`` package consists of a single Python package named\r\n`qwt` and of a few other files (examples, doc, ...).\r\n\r\n## Copyrights\r\n\r\n#### Main code base\r\n  - Copyright © 2002 Uwe Rathmann, for the original Qwt C++ code\r\n  - Copyright © 2015 Pierre Raybaut, for the Qwt C++ to Python\r\ntranslation and optimization\r\n  - Copyright © 2015 Pierre Raybaut, for the PythonQwt specific and\r\nexclusive Python material\r\n\r\n#### PyQt, PySide and Python2/Python3 compatibility modules\r\n  - Copyright © 2009-2013 Pierre Raybaut\r\n  - Copyright © 2013-2015 The Spyder Development Team\r\n\r\n#### Some examples\r\n  - Copyright © 2003-2009 Gerard Vermeulen, for the original PyQwt code\r\n  - Copyright © 2015 Pierre Raybaut, for the PyQt5/PySide port and\r\nfurther developments (e.g. ported to PythonQwt API)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe `qwt` Python package was partly (>95%) translated from Qwt C++\r\nlibrary: the associated code is distributed under the terms of the LGPL\r\nlicense. The rest of the code was either wrote from scratch or strongly\r\ninspired from MIT licensed third-party software.\r\nSee included LICENSE file for more details about licensing terms.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThe `qwt` package is a pure Python implementation of `Qwt` C++ library \r\nwith the following limitations.\r\n\r\nThe following `Qwt` classes won't be reimplemented in `qwt` because more\r\npowerful features already exist in `guiqwt`: `QwtPlotZoomer`, \r\n`QwtCounter`, `QwtEventPattern`, `QwtPicker`, `QwtPlotPicker`.\r\n\r\nOnly the following plot items are currently implemented in `qwt` (the \r\nonly plot items needed by `guiqwt`): `QwtPlotItem` (base class), \r\n`QwtPlotItem`, `QwtPlotMarker`, `QwtPlotSeriesItem` and `QwtPlotCurve`.\r\n\r\nSee \"Overview\" section in [documentation](http://pythonhosted.org/PythonQwt/) \r\nfor more details on API limitations when comparing to Qwt.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n### Requirements ###\r\n- Python >=2.6 or Python >=3.0\r\n- PyQt4 >=4.4 or PyQt5 >= 5.5\r\n- NumPy >= 1.5\r\n- guidata >= 1.7 for the GUI-based test launcher\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nFrom the source package:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npython setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Examples/tests\r\n\r\nThe GUI-based test launcher may be executed from Python:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom qwt import tests\r\ntests.run()\r\n```\r\n\r\nor from the command line: `PythonQwt-tests`.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
